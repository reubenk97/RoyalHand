## Description

This project was designed to allow for small groups of 2-4 people to play common card games quickly, such as VC (Vietnamese Cards). Future card games I would like to add would be Lucky, ERS (Egyptian Rat Screw), and Speed, as a start. The initial games added will be turn-based, and eventually I will add real-time games as well.

## Installation

Installation directions will be provided when the app is further developed.

## Usage

1. A host player can create a lobby that others can join to play card games.
2. Others can join the lobby and wait for the host to pick the game and start.
3. Compete in turn-based (or real-time as my future endeavor) style of play until a player wins. The host may choose to restart the game or return to the lobby and possibly change the game.

## Credits

None currently.
